# LTEBS_2021_II_Group_06_EAGLE

### Notes on Group_06_Library.lbr
-	We have decided to design the pads for both components TMUX1208 (package QFN-16) and TCA9546A (package TSSOP-16) with a rectangular shape. 
-	In order to add the microcontroller, we have downloaded the following library: CY8KIT- 059.lbr
-	Regarding package dimension of component TMUX1208 we have decided to keep the middle value between maximum and minimum dimension (1.80mmx2.60mm).
-	Regarding package dimension of component TCA9546A we have decided to keep the middle value between maximum and minimum dimension (4.4mmx5mm).

### Notes on Group_06.sch 
-	Schematic is divided into two pages.
-	We have added a switch S1 not present in the table of the assignment, but existing in the schematic. The switch we have added is the following: SWITCH_SPDT_PTH_11.6X4.0MM.
-	We have added a connector J8 not present in the table of the assignment, but existing in the schematic. The connector we have added is the following: CONN_08 1X08.
